This is the repository for my personal website! The structure of the repository was based on the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The main goal of the site is to give myself somewhere to play with different code practices and host my resume online!

It is built with: 

* React
* Some CSS here
* Other stuff
* Omg that stuff too?
